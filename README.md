# Federated Learning with Homomorphic Encryption: An Analysis of Techniques for Secure Aggregation and  Efficient Communication
This project aims to demonstrate the potential of using FL with HE techniques in the healthcare industry while addressing the challenges involved. In this implementation, we showcase a comprehensive methodology for implementing federated learning on CIFAR-10 and MNIST data using homomorphic encryption and federated aggregation algorithms.

## Dataset

CIFAR-10: It is a labeled image dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, used for object recognition tasks.  

MNIST: This dataset is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits, each 28x28 pixels in size, commonly used as a benchmark for image classification tasks in machine learning.


## Models

NN Models: ResNet18 for CIFAR-10 classification, NN with conv and fc layers for MNIST data classification.  

FL Schemes: FedAVG(current), FedProx(future)

HE Schemes: CKKS(current), Paillier(future), BFV(future)
